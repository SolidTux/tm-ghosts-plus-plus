# Ghost Picker

**Requires MLHook** -- you must also have MLHook installed.

Pick any ghost (or ghosts) from the leaderboards to race against in solo.

- Ghosts around your PB.
- Ghosts around a specific rank.
- Ghosts a bit faster than your PB.
- Ghosts that are 500ms, 1000ms, 1500ms, ... faster than your PB (ghosts that are at regular intervals).
